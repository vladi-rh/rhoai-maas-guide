# MaaS demos

Seven demos showing how Models as a Service governs access to a model: **who may
call it**, and **how much they may consume**.

Each demo runs against a cluster with MaaS deployed (`./scripts/setup-maas.sh`
from the repository root). Each folder contains a setup script, a README with a
runbook and a talk track, and a teardown script.

## The demos

| Demo | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| [user-level-rate-limiting](user-level-rate-limiting/) | Assigning a `MaaSSubscription` to a group or to an individual user, and using `priority` to give a named user a different tier from the rest of their team. |
| [subscription-priority](subscription-priority/) | That entitlement is selected rather than accumulated: a user in two groups worth 10000 and 20000 tokens/hour gets one of those tiers, not 30000 — and a subscription naming them individually can cap them below both. |
| [oidc-authentication](oidc-authentication/) | Authenticating with an identity from your own identity provider — no OpenShift account required — with the token's `groups` claim selecting the subscription. Includes a click-through UI and a CLI sample client. |
| [service-account-access](service-account-access/) | An application calling a model with its own Kubernetes ServiceAccount token. No API key to distribute, no credential to rotate. Access granted per namespace, rate limits set per workload. |
| [corporate-scenario](corporate-scenario/) | A realistic CIO assignment: three divisions (Sales, Engineering, Products) with differentiated access to on-prem and cloud models, each with appropriate token budgets. Full governance lifecycle from policy to verification. |
| [jwks-cache](jwks-cache/) | That JWT signatures are genuinely verified, and that verification happens locally against a cached copy of the issuer's public keys rather than a call to the identity provider on every request. |
| [cross-cluster-oauth](cross-cluster-oauth/) | AI agent workloads on a separate Workload cluster authenticating to MaaS via Keycloak's client-credentials flow. Dedicated AITenant, group-based subscriptions, per-agent overrides, coordinated agent start signal. |

## Readiness check

```bash
./preflight.sh
```

Read-only — it creates nothing and applies no YAML. It confirms every identity
can authenticate and resolves the subscription its demo expects, and sends a
warm-up request so the first click of the demo is a warm one. Pass a demo name
as an argument to check only that demo's section.

Expect `16 passed, 0 failed` when running all demos.

Setup is applied once, ahead of time; the demos themselves only read. The single
exception is `jwks-cache/prove-cached.sh`, which applies a NetworkPolicy as the
demonstration itself and removes it again on exit.
